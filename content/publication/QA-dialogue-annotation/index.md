abstract: "We present a taxonomy of questions and answers based on real-life data extracted from spontaneous dialogue corpora. This classification allowed us to build a fine-grained annotation schema, which we applied to several languages: English, French, Italian and Chinese. 

The annotation guideline [Where's The Answer: Dialogue Annotation](http://institut-sciences-digitales.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Report_Supervised_Project.pdf) is designed as a multilingual-compatible fine-grained annotation schema that could account for complex structure of the spontaneous conversations.

Our research takes root in the inquiries currently pursued in the [SLAM project (Schizophrenie et Langage, Analyse et Mod́elisation)](https://team.inria.fr/semagramme/fr/slam/) developed by the [SEMAGRAMME](https://www.loria.fr/en/research/teams/semagramme/) group at LORIA whose main goal is to analyze the conversations between schizophrenic patients and identify the inconsistencies in dialogue."
