Yi-Ting Clara Tsai graduated Magna Cum Laude with Master in Natural Language Processing(NLP) from Institut des sciences du Digital, Management & Cognition (IDMC) of the Universit√© de Lorraine in the year of 2020. Her interest topics include Text Mining, Argument Mining and Ontology with an emphasis on the domain of Business, Politics and eHealth. 

Proficient in Python and NLP/data science frameworks (Tensorflow, Keras, Trax, Pytorch, SpaCy, HuggingFace, Numpy, Scikit-learn, etc); actively learning Java/Scala and Spark Framework. Also, she spends her free time on learning new techs, such as Cloud-Scale Machine Learning with Google Cloud Platform and Generative Adversarial Networks GANs.

Her expertise in NLP/Data Science/Deep Learning and her previous background of the study in Social Science show the uniqueness. The end-of-studies internship at academic research lab in [LORIA Lorraine Research Laboratory in Computer Science and its Applications](https://www.loria.fr/en/) gave her opportunity to work in Argumentation Theories with Formal Concept Analysis inside data-mining-specialized team Orpailleur.
